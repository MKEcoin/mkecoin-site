"`monero-wallet-cli` is the wallet software that ships with the Monero "
"tree. It is a console program, and manages an account. While a bitcoin "
"wallet manages both an account and the blockchain, Monero separates these: "
"`monerod` handles the blockchain, and `monero-wallet-cli` handles the "
"account."
